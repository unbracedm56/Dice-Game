# Dice Game

This is a simple Dice Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to roll dice and get a random outcome, making it a fun and interactive way to simulate dice rolls.

## Features

- **Interactive Dice Roll**: Users can roll the dice and see the outcome represented visually with images.
- **Randomized Outcomes**: Each roll produces a random number between 1 and 6, just like a real dice.
- **Simple Design**: Clean and minimalistic design using CSS.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/unbracedm56/Dice-Game.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Dice-Game
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to play the game.

## How It Works

- The game is controlled by the script.js file, which uses JavaScript to generate random numbers and update the dice images accordingly.
- The layout and design are handled by styles.css.
- The images folder contains the images for the six faces of the dice.
